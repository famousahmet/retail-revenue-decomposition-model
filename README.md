# Retail Revenue Decomposition — ABV × Transactions Model

This project analyzes the core drivers of retail revenue by breaking it into its two fundamental components:

1. **Transactions** (customer traffic)
2. **Average Basket Value (ABV)**

The model includes:

- ABV regression (Promo + Discount + Transactions)
- Discount elasticity estimation
- Revenue decomposition into ΔTransactions vs ΔABV
- Mini FP&A revenue bridge
- Notebook, dataset and visualizations

## 🧠 Why This Model Matters (FP&A + Retail Analytics)

Retailers like Aldi, Lidl, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour make daily decisions based on:

- Promo effectiveness  
- Discount impact  
- Basket behavior  
- Customer traffic patterns  

This model answers key business questions:

- “Did sales increase because more customers came, or because basket value grew?”
- “How much does discounting reduce ABV?”
- “Which driver (Transactions vs ABV) contributed more to revenue change?”
- “What is the effective discount elasticity?”
